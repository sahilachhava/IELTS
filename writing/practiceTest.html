                        <p>The two pie charts draw the conclusion of a survey of boys' and girls' cultural and leisure activities.</p>

                        <p>Overall, equal quantities of both sexes enjoyed listening to music, but a dramatically larger number of girls liked reading. There were also many differences in terms of the children's preferred sports.</p>

                        <p>Turning to the first chart, we can observe that boys prefer playing computer games (34% participation rate) than taking other activities. Playing basketball comes as the second most popular leisure, practiced by almost a third of male children. Basketball is followed by soccer, which is exercised by 17%. Skateboarding and listening to music are less preferable activities, chosen by 11% and 10% of boys respectively. Reading, the least popular cultural activity among boys, represents only two percent.</p>

                        <p>Taking a closer look at the second chart, we can see that girls' most preferred activity is dancing, being 27% of the total. In contrast to the boys' preferences, reading is chosen by more than a fifth of all girls. Although percentage of female children who play computer games is roughly twice less than that of boys (16%), this activity is third most popular on the girls' chart. With a slight difference between computer games and netball, the latter is practiced at 15% rate. Similarly to skateboarding popularity among boys, 11% of girls go in for gymnastics. Listening to music comes as the least popular leisure, with a proportion of 10%, equal to those on the first chart.</p>

                            The pictures illustrate the changes, which have taken place at West Park secondary school from 1950 to 2010.
                            <br> <br>
                            Firstly, significant alterations occurred to the farmland, it was redesigned to a sports field in 1980 and then to a car park in 2010. There was an expansion of the car park in 2010 and the sport field was placed between the car park and the playground.
                            <br> <br>
                            Moreover, substantial changes happened to the houses. They were removed from the map, car park and science block taking their place.
                            <br> <br>
                            Furthermore, a science block was added to the school building in 1980 and playground was reduced in size. However, the locations of the playground and school were not modified.
                            <br> <br>
                            In contrast, the main road remained unchanged throughout the period.
                            <br> <br>
                            Overall, farmland and houses disappeared from the map, playground was abridged, and there were built science block, car park and sports field.</p>

                            The line graph illustrates the average cost that American customers spent on mobile and landline phone services annually over a 10-year period.
                            <br> <br>
                            Overall, spending on residential phone services dramatically declined, while popularity of mobile services increased sharply throughout a decade. Also, both of services met at the same record in 2006.

Then, cell phone expenses rose to approximately $750 in 2010, making nearly a fourfold jump relatively to its initial figure in 2001. Meanwhile, spending on residential phone services experienced a steep fall in 2007 and went on to steadily decrease for the rest of the period.

                            The bar chart compares the yearly number of visitors in 3 different museums from 2007 to 2012.
                            <br> <br>
                            Overall, the peak of visitors' number was in 2012, while the lowest point was in 2009 and 2010.
                            <br> <br>
                            Victoria and Albert Museum was the most popular from 2007 to 2009. During 2007-2008 its annual number of visitors remained constant at about 14 million people per year. However, the figure started to decline rapidly in 2009, and reached its lowest point of about 8 millions in 2010, becoming the least popular museum for the rest of the period. After that, the number of Victoria and Albert Museum's visitors gradually rose up to 10 million visitors within 2 years.
                            <br> <br>
                            British Museum was the second most popular in 2007, being outraced by Victoria and Albert Museum. Nevertheless, its number of visitors experienced a sharp fall in 2008 and remained unchanged the following year. Then, the figure started to increase. It reached its peak of approximately 14 million visitors in 2012, regaining its position of 2007.
                            <br> <br>
                            National Gallery Museum showed the most notable development with a steady growth throughout the period. Being the least popular museum in the beginning, it experienced a growth of more than 10 million visitors over 6-year period, and became the most visited museum in 2012.

                            Nowadays, there are a lot of students who work while studying. Although this tendency may lead to negative results, the number of young people who sacrifice education for work is growing. I believe that this problem has certain causes and can be solved by taking special measures.
                            <br> <br>
                            It is apparent that most of the students who work have many financial expenses to meet. One common cause is high cost of education. As many colleges and universities set high tuition fees, some families cannot fully afford the higher education for their children. Consequently, these students have to work to pay university and college fees. The other cause is living expenses. Many students study away from hometown, and have to pay for accommodation, food, entertainment etc. As it is often hard to cover these expenses, students are forced to earn money to afford their living. I think that the problem of students working during their studies results in lower quality of education and has no benefits at all. Thus, it should be solved on the governmental level.
                            <br> <br>
                            I can suggest two possible solutions to this problem. Firstly, the government could make higher education free. For instance, this result can be achieved by financing educational establishments from the countryâs budget. Not only will it make universities and colleges accessible for everyone, but it will also reduce the number of working students. The second solution is promoting unpaid e-learning. Such form of distance education doesnât require a lot of resources to be maintained. Whatâs more, students donât have to leave their homes and can plan their schedules the way they prefer.
                            <br> <br>
                            In conclusion, I believe that mainly lack of financial resources causes students to work, but this problem can be solved by lowering the amount of financial expenses students have to meet.

                            It is often argued that it is more advantageous to choose a job with high wage, even if it doesn't appeal to you at all. I completely disagree with this opinion and think that job satisfaction is much more important than salary.
                            <br> <br>
                            First of all, I believe that job satisfaction gives people a sense of fulfillment that no money can guarantee. Even if someone is earning a high salary, but feels tensed and compromises with his conscience, this person wonât enjoy his life. While pursuing oneâs interests will always bring pleasure and feeling of satisfaction. For example, a lot of famous researchers made their career choices not because of appealing wages, but because they were passionate about science. Thatâs why itâs more important to choose the kind of work that makes you happy than to look only at a high salary.
                            <br> <br>
                            Secondly, doing what you like keeps you motivated and therefore leads to a career growth. In other words, there is a strong relation between job satisfaction and productivity. People who love their jobs can easily excel in their fields of work and achieve better results than those, who put salary on the first place. For instance, Henry Miller decided to leave his everyday job despite a good wage and ventured to become a writer. And after enduring years of ups and downs he became one of the most famous and well-paid authors of the twentieth century. Thus, advantages of jobs that keep you satisfied outweigh the drawback of a low salary in a long-term perspective.
                            <br> <br>
                            To conclude, I strongly believe that job satisfaction is more beneficial than high salary because it makes people happy and motivated.

                            These days a sedentary lifestyle is becoming more and more popular despite a big number of sport facilities. This essay will discuss the main problems associated with this epidemic and propose some possible solutions to avoid them.
                            <br> <br>
                            The main problems caused by inactive lifestyle are obesity and various spine disorders. A growing number of body research shows that long periods of physical inactivity raise a risk of becoming overweight. This is because people burn fewer calories and easily gain weight. Whatâs more, a lot of studies show that so-called âsitting diseaseâ often results in posture and backbone problems. Due to constant sitting, person loses muscle tissue and curves spine, developing numerous spinal diseases. For example, it has been proven that about 80% of people experience backache at least once a week.
                            <br> <br>
                            In my opinion, the best solution to these problems is promoting active lifestyle. Firstly, millions of people stay less active because they use cars instead of walking. Therefore, an effective way to make people more active is to advertise walking and cycling as safe and attractive alternatives to motorized transport. Moreover, inactive lifestyle is gaining popularity because nowadays a lot of people prefer passive rest to workouts in the gym. And the best way to avoid the hazards of unhealthy living is to obtain a regular dose of physical activity. Thus, promoting gyms and regular exercising would increase the level of activity.
                            <br> <br>
                            In conclusion, leading a sedentary lifestyle causes a lot of health problems, including obesity and spinal diseases. The most effective solution is to increase the level of fitness among the society by advertising physical activity.

                            These days, the amount of violence in media is growing. While some people argue that this trend will undoubtedly lead humans to dangerous future, others claim that it has no damaging effect on the society. I believe that in most cases media violence doesn't affect people's behavior.
                            <br> <br>
                            Firstly, I think that people act from their motives, regardless what they see on the television. That is to say, if someone intends to do harm to somebody, that is not because of watching TV or playing computer games, but due to that person's character and education. Although it is generally considered that violent media accustoms viewers to cruelty, I doubt this opinion. In my view, reasonable and intelligent people treat others humanely irrespective of what they see or hear in fictional stories.
                            <br> <br>
                            Moreover, video games and television may even reduce social violence by providing a safe outlet for aggressiveness. In other words, truculent people may fight in virtual reality instead of evincing their combative spirit in real world. This may not only help those people, but also reduce the level of social violence in long-term perspective.
                            <br> <br>
                            Finally, despite many claims and assumptions about negative effects of television and computer games I have never seen any proven connection between violent media and illegal activities in social life.
                            <br> <br>
                            Taking everything into consideration, I would say that violence in contemporary media has no substantial influence on people's behavior. Television and computers are not the main factors that shape personal character, and they can even be useful in reducing the level of violence.

                            Many people believe that death penalty is necessary to keep security system efficient in the society. While there are some negative aspects of capital punishment, I agree with the view that without it we will become more vulnerable to violence.
                            <br> <br>
                            Death penalty can be considered unsuitable punishment for several reasons. The strongest argument is that we have no rights to kill other humans. Right to live is the basic right of any human being, and no one can infringe this right, irrespective of the personâs deeds. Moreover, innocent people can face wrongful execution. Such unfair sentences take away lives of innocent people and make other citizens lose faith in law and justice. And besides, sometimes criminals repent of their acts. In this case they should be given a second chance to improve themselves.
                            <br> <br>
                            However, I believe that capital punishment is necessary in the society. Firstly, it is an effective deterrent of major crimes. The best method to prevent a person from committing crime is to show the consequences of his or her actions. For example, the government of Pakistan has controlled the rate of terrorism by enforcing death penalties for the members of terrorist organisations. Secondly, the governments spend large sums of national budget on maintenance of prisoners. Instead, this money can be used for the development of the society and welfare of the people.
